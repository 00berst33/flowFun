# flowFun
R package containing functions for analysis of flow cytometry data.

Priority:
- make output of doDEAnalysis() more user friendly, particularly the `data` component
- make incorporating FMO and isotype controls more straightforward
- plotGroupUMAPs() and plotLabeled2DScatter() each have a case that still needs
  to be accounted for
- preprocessing steps
- generate data for examples in functions used after initial clustering
- links in documentation need to be added or cleaned up
